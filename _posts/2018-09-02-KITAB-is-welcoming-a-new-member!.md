KITAB members are happy to welcome Claire Savina, our new research associate. Claire is a comparative literature and Arabic studies researcher and is interested in the translation, circulation and history of texts, as well as world literature and intertextuality across literatures. She is now assisting Sarah in managing the project and the team.
