A new version (version 2020.2.3) of the [OpenITI](https://github.com/OpenITI) corpus is available at [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/4075046), an Open Science platform that supports Open Access. This is the third release (second release in 2020) developed by the OpenITI organization. It is also accessible at [GitHub](https://github.com/OpenITI/RELEASE).



The current release features 7,725 books, including all versions and editions (1,573,262,381 words), of which 4,781 are unique books written by 2,074  authors. In the release, 680 new books (with their ids) have been added. In terms of annotation, 773 books are available in first-stage OpenITI mARkdown, of which 79 have been reviewed and vetted by the annotation team (this being the second stage of our annotation process). The vetted texts have .mARkdown extension.



The new texts and changes to the URIs as well as the statistics on the corpus are listed in the release note, which is available in the publication link above (also available [here](https://github.com/OpenITI/RELEASE/blob/master/OpenITI_release-note_2020-2-3.pdf)).



We are adding more texts to the OpenITI corpus. If you wish to contribute to OpenITI and add books or manuscripts that are not in the OpenITI please contact Lorenz Nigst or any of the team members.
