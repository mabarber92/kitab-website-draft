The Aga Khan University-ISMC is seeking three post-doctoral research fellows to work with an international and interdisciplinary group of investigators for the European Research Council-funded project, KITAB (Knowledge, Information Technology, and the Arabic Book ). The project, led by Sarah Bowen Savant (Aga Khan University-ISMC) is focused on the way that texts were “reused” in the period of 700–1500 across the Arabic speaking world. We are specifically interested in what the recycling of texts can reveal about the history of books in this period, and more deeply, about how memory was generated in the pre-modern Middle East.
