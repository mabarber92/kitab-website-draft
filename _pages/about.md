# Message from the PI 

KITAB provides a digital tool-box and a forum for discussions about Arabic texts. We wish to empower users to explore Arabic texts in completely new ways and to expand the frontiers of knowledge about one of the world’s largest and most complex textual traditions.

We are leading with a tool that detects how authors copied previous works. Arabic authors frequently made use of past works, cutting them into pieces and reconstituting them to address their own outlooks and concerns. Now you can discover relationships between these texts and also the profoundly intertextual circulatory systems in which they sit.

Our most recent work has involved gathering statistics on reuse across the tradition. This includes the extent and precision of reuse, and where it does and does not occur. We are also developing new visualisations that show the relationships between authors, books, and the ideas that they contain. Equally importantly, we are building the corpus of texts upon which our research is based, and making use of our pioneering work on Optical Character Recognition.

The technology that powers KITAB is at the cutting edge of computer science and we are deeply indebted to our partners. Our first algorithm has been developed by David Smith of Northeastern University. Gregory Crane (editor-in-chief of the Perseus Digital Library and the Alexander von Humboldt Chair in the Digital Humanities at Leipzig University) has been a major collaborator from the start on many aspects of the project. For funding, we are grateful to the support that we have received from the Aga Khan University and the British Academy.

To use our corpus and search tools, please start with "Our Pilot." This provides you with a brief view into the sort of data and tools that we are creating. It is only a sample. We are applying for funding that would allow us to bring all of our data and sources into the public domain.

Thank you for your interest in KITAB!

Kind regards,<br>

### Maxim Romanov, Senior Research Fellow
Maxim Romanov is a Universitätsassistent für Digital Humanities at the Institute for History, University of Vienna. His dissertation (Near Eastern Studies, U of Michigan, 2013) explored how modern computational techniques of text analysis can be applied to the study of premodern Arabic historical sources. In particular, he studied “The History of Islam” (Taʾrīḫ al-islām), the largest of surviving biographical collections with over 30,000 biographies, written by the Damascene scholar al-Ḏahabī (d. 1348 CE). Currently, he continues his study of this biographical collection (The History of Islam: An Essay in Digital Humanities), which will serve as methodological and infrastructural foundation for the study of all surviving Arabic biographical collections and chronicles. Additionally, besides KITAB, he is working on other foundational projects for the field of Arabic and Islamic studies, which include the OpenITI (former OpenArabic), a machine-readable corpus of classical Arabic texts, and al-Ṯurayyā, a gazetteer of the classical Islamic world.

### Kevin Jaques, Digital Sirah Project

Kevin Jaques is an Associate Professor of Islamic Studies in the Department of Religious Studies at Indiana University.

He is a specialist in classical Islamic biography, Islamic law, and theology as well as religious hermeneutics and comparative religions. He has written two books,  _Authority, Conflict, and the Transmission of Diversity in Medieval Islamic Law_ (Brill, 2006) and _Ibn Ḥajar al-ʿAsqalānī_ (Oxford, 2010), as well as numerous articles.

Jaques is currently working on reconstructing the various versions of Muḥammad b. Isḥāq’s _Sīrah Rasūl Allāh_, the earliest biography of the Prophet Muḥammad and one of our most important sources for understanding how Muslims in the 2nd/8th century viewed Muḥammad within the context of the rapidly expanding Muslim world. Ibn Isḥāq (d. 150/767) lived during a time of great change and produced different versions of his work as he traveled across the late Umayyad and early ʿAbbāsid Empires. Jaques’ project is to reconstruct those different versions as a window onto how Muslim worldviews developed over this period and in the different regions in which Ibn Isḥāq traveled. He is in the process of completing a collection of over 60 different witnesses to the work that he plans to publish together with a five volume series on the author and the _Sīrah_.

The first volume, The Captives of _ʿAyn al-Tamr_, will examine the first two centuries of Islam through the lens of those captured and enslaved at the Battle of ʿAyn al-Tamr (12/633), and how they and their descendants became contributors to the early Muslim tradition. Ibn Isḥāq’s grandfather, Yasār, was a child when he was enslaved at the battle and later manumitted. The lives and experiences of manumitted slaves (_mawālī_ sing. _mawlā_) is the central theme of the volume and will serve as a means of understanding many of the religious, social, economic, and political issues that helped form Ibn Isḥāq’s understanding if the world.

### Ryan Muther, Digital Sirah Project

Ryan Muther is a PhD student in the Computer Science program at Northeastern University advised by Professor David Smith. He is interested in applying techniques from natural language processing to archival data to address questions in disciplines outside of computer science. Prior to joining the PhD program in 2016, he earned his Bachelor of Science degree from Union College in Computer Science and History. While working with David Smith, Ryan has worked on applying and improving text reuse analysis algorithms to a variety of domains, ranging from modeling editing in US Congressional bills to tracking the spread of news in a multilingual corpus of 19th centurynewspapers. His work with Congressional bills was written up as Charting the Changes: Modeling Edits in the Lawmaking Process and presented at the 2017 PoliInformatics workshop in Seattle, WA.For the Kitab project, Ryan is working on developing improved models of text reuse that will help the humanists on the team more easily find and understand how Ibn Ishaq’s work was reused and modified by later authors. In terms of broader goals, he would like to better understand how to integrate domain knowledge from experts to build better models of historical linguistic phenomena from archival data.

### Mathew Barber, Research Associate (Digital Sirah Project)
Mathew Barber is a PhD Candidate at the department of Middle Eastern Studies in the University of Edinburgh. His doctoral research (entitled: ‘Text reuse and memory in Egypt: al-Maqrīzī’s muqaffā as a lost Fatimid source for the vizierate of al-Yāzūrī (r. 1050–8).’) analyses patterns of text reuse in the Egyptian historiography to shed light on lost Fatimid sources. He is interested more broadly in the representation of the Fatimids in Egyptian historical memory through the study of text reuse. Contemporary sources for the Fatimids are rare, especially for the eleventh and twelfth centuries, but later Egyptian historical writing on the Fatimids (especially the Mamluk historiography) is especially rich. As such, he is excited about the possibilities that digital humanities could bring to this field, providing insights into the composition of Egyptian historiography and potentially lost Fatimid texts and traditions.

## Cultural Memory in the Pre-Modern Middle East: Köprülü 01589, A Library Manuscript

This paper features my first application of KITAB’s text reuse detection methods to a manuscript transcription. It was delivered Nov. 22, 2015 at the Middle East Studies Annual Meeting in Denver for a panel entitled “Imagining the Ummah.” The panel papers focused on the composition, meaning, and reception of sources pertaining to the first centuries of the Muslim community (600-1000). The paper’s contents (which reflect oral delivery, the audience, and the 20 minute time limit) will be revised, expanded, and incorporated into my 2017 University of Leiden LUCIS lectures.

## Oxford PhD Thesis uses KITAB to Assess Reception History of Major Arabic Book on the Early Caliphate

The *Futūḥ al-buldān* by Aḥmad Ibn Yaḥyā al-Balādhurī (died c. 892) is a most important source for our knowledge of the early Islamic caliphate. In his 2016 Oxford PhD thesis, Ryan Lynch uses KITAB to identify the types of material that later authors borrowed from the *Futūḥ*. He is the first scholar to extensively study the reception of the *Futūḥ* and shows the significant impact al-Balādhurī’s book had on subsequent generations. Later authors liberally borrowed from al-Balādhurī’s book, often without giving him credit. A famous work on geography from the thirteenth century known as the *Muʿjam al-buldān* ("Dictionary of Countries"), for example, features verbatim material from almost every part of al-Balādhurī’s book – running from the Prophet Muḥammad’s *hijra* to Medina through to the conquests of South Asia.
