The KITAB project is chiefly engaged in the study of book history. We employ data such as [text reuse evidence]({{ '/methods/text-reuse' | relative_url }}) and patterns in [*isnad*s]({{ '/methods/sub-genre' | relative_url }}) to address questions such as* How were books written?* How did writing practices change over time?* How was the reuse of text valued by contemporaries and what kinds of reuse might have been considered intellectual theft?
