The KITAB project is chiefly understanding in the study of book history. We employ data such as [text reuse data]({{ '/methods/text-reuse' | relative_url }}), and patterns of [*isnads*]({{ '/methods/sub-genre' | relative_url }}) usage, to understand questions such as:
* How were books written?
* How did writing practices change over time?
* How was the reuse of text valued by contemporaries, was kinds of reuse might have been considered as intellectual theft?
