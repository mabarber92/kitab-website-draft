Citation practices are at the heart of study of book history. Through the identification of [*isnads*]({{ '/methods/sub-genre' | relative_url }}) and the identification of [names and networks]({{ '/methods/networks' }}) that *isnads* represent, we are exploring how authors use citations, and what they mean when they use *isnads*. In combination with [text reuse]({{ 'methods/text-reuse' | relative_url }}) data, we can also study how certain authors fail to cite authorities, and cases when they do.

These matters and other related research questions are explored in the following blogs:
