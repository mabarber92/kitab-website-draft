Citation practices are at the heart of the study of book history. Through the identification of [*isnad*s]({{ '/methods/sub-genre' | relative_url }}) and of the [names and networks]({{ '/methods/networks' }}) that *isnad*s represent, we are exploring how authors use citations and what they mean when they use *isnad*s.

These matters and other related research questions are explored in the following blog posts:
