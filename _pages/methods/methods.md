Welcome to the methods section of the website. The KITAB team is proud to be involved in research that is at the cutting edge of Computer Science and Natural Language Processing. We are keen to stress that we do not treat methods in Natural Language Processing as a *black box*. These are methods that have to intuitively refined to suit the langauges and texts to which they applied. They must be improved through collaboration between experts in the methods (typically computer scientists) and experts in the texts. 

It is for this reason that we give so much emphasis to methods here. Anyone using our data or reading our publications should be able to read about understand and critique our methods. It also gives us space and opportunity to keep you updated about our work to improve methods for text analysis.

We have decided to split this section in our website into two. The first 'How we study' describes the computational methods that we employ and which we are involved in developing. This will engage with the more technical dimensions of how these methods work and how we are working to improve them. Those involved in research in Natural Language Processing or other fields of computer science may find these pages of greatest interest.

The second deals with how we are employing these various methods to answer historical questions. These sections will be grounded with real research, providing links to our latest blogs on the subject. If you're researching history or Arabic literature then these pages are more likely to be of interest to you.

Nonetheless, we encourage you to read these pages regardless of your disciplinary background. They remain our official guides to the methods that we use and the manner in which they work. We will reference these pages in our blogs and publications and will update them as our work advances.
