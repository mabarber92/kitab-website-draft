### Sarah Bowen Savant
Professor Savant is a cultural historian specialising in the Middle East and Iran ca. 600-1500. Her work on KITAB is motivated by a desire to write a cultural history of the Arabic book using digital tools. Her publications include The New Muslims of Post-Conquest Iran: Tradition, Memory, and Conversion (Cambridge University Press, 2013; winner of the Said-Sirjani book award given by the International Society for Iranian Studies on behalf of the Persian Heritage Foundation); as editor (with Helena de Felipe), Genealogy and Knowledge in Muslim Societies: Understanding the Past (AKU-ISMC, Exploring Muslim Contexts/Edinburgh University Press, 2014); as translator (with Peter Webb), The Excellence of the Arabs. A Translation of Ibn Qutaybah’s Faḍl al-ʿArab wa l-tanbīh ʿalā ʿulūmihā (The Library of Arabic Literature/New York University Press, 2017); and numerous articles treating ethnic identity, cultural memory, genealogy, and history writing. She serves as president of Middle East Medievalists and as an ex-officio member of the editorial board of its online, open-access journal, Al-ʿUsur al-Wusta. She is also a board member of the British Institute for the Study of Iraq, and a member of the editorial board of its journal, Iraq. In 2016-17, she was a mid-career fellow of the British Academy and a fellow at the Leiden University Centre for the Study of Islam and Society. During that time she prepared much of her next book, based on KITAB’s data: A Cultural History of the Arabic Book (Leiden: Brill, 2019, expected). Updates on KITAB are regularly posted on her Twitter account"

### Abdul Rahman Azzam
With a BA and Dphil from Oxford University, Dr Azzam’s focus is on the development of Islamic thought from the medieval to the modern Muslim world and the interaction between traditional Islam and modernity. He is the author of Saladin (2008) and The Other Exile (2017). Since 2007 Abdul Rahman has been working at Qatar Foundation where he has led several important cultural and educational projects. He was delegated by Sheikha Moza to lead and negotiate the partnership between The British Library and Qatar Foundation. The first phase of the partnership, signed in July 2012, created a state-of-the-art online portal of materials on Gulf History with over half a million documents digitised. Abdul Rahman also negotiated and launched the joint venture deal between Bloomsbury and Qatar Foundation to establish a regional publishing house. Bloomsbury Qatar Foundation was launched in the presence of HM Queen Elizabeth at Windsor in April 2010."
