### Karen Bauer
![Karen Bauer](/images/kitab/karen_bauer_200px.jpg){: .align-left} 
Dr. Karen Bauer (PhD, Princeton), Senior Research Associate in the [Qur’anic Studies Unit](https://www.iis.ac.uk/research/quranic-studies) of the Institute of Ismaili Studies, London. Dr. Bauer's research centres on the Qurʾan and its reception history, the history of emotions in Islam, and gender in Islamic history and thought. Although she is mostly known as a medievalist, she occasionally ventures into modern territory, such as when she interviewed religious scholars in Iran and Syria for her book *Gender Hierarchy in the Qur’an: Medieval Interpretations, Modern Responses* (Cambridge University Press, 2015), which detailed the history of tafsir through interpretations of verses on women, and was runner up for the BKFS Book Prize 2016. She edited a volume entitled *Aims, Methods, and Contexts of Qur'anic Exegesis, 2nd/8th - 9th/15th centuries)* (OUP/IIS, 2013), and, along with Feras Hamza, has recently completed *An Anthology of Qur'anic Commentaries, Volume 2: On Women* (Oxford University Press/IIS, 2021), which comprises annotated translations of Qur'anic commentaries and extensive introductory materials, including a chapter on women in the Qurʾān. This latter forms the basis for her current project, also with Feras Hamza, a critical introduction to women in the Qurʾān. She is also writing a book entitled *Islamic Affect: Emotions from Muḥammad to the Middle Ages*. She has published articles on subjects as diverse as women's right to be judges in Islamic law, the audiences of tafsir, and emotional rhetoric in the Qurʾān. Dr. Bauer serves on the board and the nominating committee of the International Qur’anic Studies Association (IQSA). Many of her publications can be found on her [academia.edu page](https://iis.academia.edu/KarenBauer). 

### Ryan Muther
![Ryan Muther](/images/kitab/ryan200px.jpg){: .align-left}
Ryan Muther is a PhD student in the Computer Science program at Northeastern University advised by Professor David Smith. He is interested in applying techniques from natural language processing to archival data to address questions in disciplines outside of computer science. Prior to joining the PhD program in 2016, he earned his Bachelor of Science degree from Union College in Computer Science and History. While working with David Smith, Ryan has worked on applying and improving text reuse analysis algorithms to a variety of domains, ranging from modeling editing in US Congressional bills to tracking the spread of news in a multilingual corpus of 19th centurynewspapers. His work with Congressional bills was written up as Charting the Changes: Modeling Edits in the Lawmaking Process and presented at the 2017 PoliInformatics workshop in Seattle, WA.For the Kitab project, Ryan is working on developing improved models of text reuse that will help the humanists on the team more easily find and understand how Ibn Ishaq’s work was reused and modified by later authors. In terms of broader goals, he would like to better understand how to integrate domain knowledge from experts to build better models of historical linguistic phenomena from archival data.
