Prior to joining the PhD program in 2016, he earned his Bachelor of Science degree from Union College in Computer Science and History. While working with David Smith, Ryan has worked on applying and improving text reuse analysis algorithms to a variety of domains, ranging from modeling editing in US Congressional bills to tracking the spread of news in a multilingual corpus of 19th centurynewspapers. His work with Congressional bills was written up as Charting the Changes: Modeling Edits in the Lawmaking Process and presented at the 2017 PoliInformatics workshop in Seattle, WA.For the Kitab project, Ryan is working on developing improved models of text reuse that will help the humanists on the team more easily find and understand how Ibn Ishaq’s work was reused and modified by later authors. In terms of broader goals, he would like to better understand how to integrate domain knowledge from experts to build better models of historical linguistic phenomena from archival data.

### David Smith
![David Smith](/images/kitab/david200px.jpg){: .align-left}
David Smith is an associate professor in Northeastern University’s College of Computer and Information Science. He is a founding member of the NULab for Texts, Maps, and Networks (neu.edu/nulab), Northeastern’s center for research in the digital humanities and computational social sciences. His research in natural language processing has focused both on building statistical models of linguistic phenomena in morphology, syntax, and semantics and on applications to information retrieval, machine translation, digital libraries, the humanities, and social sciences. A common theme for much of his recent research has been inferring the structure of social, political, and communication networks from the evidence of texts that propagate over those networks. With current and former NULab colleagues Ryan Cordell, Abby Mullen, and Jonathan Fitzgerald, Prof. Smith is working on Going the Rounds, a book on texts “going viral” in the nineteenth century (viraltexts.org). He holds a Ph.D. in computer science from Johns Hopkins University and an A.B. in Classics (Greek) from Harvard. In between, he worked as a research programmer for the Perseus Digital Library Project.

Abdul Rahman also led and negotiated the joint venture deal between Bloomsbury and QF to establish a quality regional publishing house. In 2019--2020, Abdul Rahman worked on a collaborative project with the Qatar National Library to develop digital methods for research into the biography of the Prophet and to prototype the development of a digital reading environment for Arabic texts and Digital Humanities.

### Kevin Jaques
![Kevin Jaques](/images/kitab/kevin200px.jpg){: .align-left}
Kevin Jaques is an Associate Professor of Islamic Studies in the Department of Religious Studies at Indiana University.

He is a specialist in classical Islamic biography, Islamic law, and theology as well as religious hermeneutics and comparative religions. He has written two books,  Authority, Conflict, and the Transmission of Diversity in Medieval Islamic Law (Brill, 2006) and Ibn Ḥajar al-ʿAsqalānī (Oxford, 2010), as well as numerous articles.

Jaques is currently working on reconstructing the various versions of Muḥammad b. Isḥāq’s Sīrah Rasūl Allāh, the earliest biography of the Prophet Muḥammad and one of our most important sources for understanding how Muslims in the 2nd/8th century viewed Muḥammad within the context of the rapidly expanding Muslim world. Ibn Isḥāq (d. 150/767) lived during a time of great change and produced different versions of his work as he traveled across the late Umayyad and early ʿAbbāsid Empires. Jaques’ project is to reconstruct those different versions as a window onto how Muslim worldviews developed over this period and in the different regions in which Ibn Isḥāq traveled. He is in the process of completing a collection of over 60 different witnesses to the work that he plans to publish together with a five volume series on the author and the Sīrah.

The first volume, The Captives of ʿAyn al-Tamr, will examine the first two centuries of Islam through the lens of those captured and enslaved at the Battle of ʿAyn al-Tamr (12/633), and how they and their descendants became contributors to the early Muslim tradition. Ibn Isḥāq’s grandfather, Yasār, was a child when he was enslaved at the battle and later manumitted. The lives and experiences of manumitted slaves (mawālī sing. mawlā) is the central theme of the volume and will serve as a means of understanding many of the religious, social, economic, and political issues that helped form Ibn Isḥāq’s understanding if the world.

### Karen Bauer
![Karen Bauer](/images/kitab/karen_bauer_200px.jpg){: .align-left} 
Dr. Karen Bauer (PhD, Princeton), Senior Research Associate in the [Qur’anic Studies Unit](https://www.iis.ac.uk/research/quranic-studies) of the Institute of Ismaili Studies, London. Dr. Bauer's research centres on the Qurʾan and its reception history, the history of emotions in Islam, and gender in Islamic history and thought. Although she is mostly known as a medievalist, she occasionally ventures into modern territory, such as when she interviewed religious scholars in Iran and Syria for her book *Gender Hierarchy in the Qur’an: Medieval Interpretations, Modern Responses* (Cambridge University Press, 2015), which detailed the history of tafsir through interpretations of verses on women, and was runner up for the BKFS Book Prize 2016. She edited a volume entitled *Aims, Methods, and Contexts of Qur'anic Exegesis, 2nd/8th - 9th/15th centuries)* (OUP/IIS, 2013), and, along with Feras Hamza, has recently completed *An Anthology of Qur'anic Commentaries, Volume 2: On Women* (Oxford University Press/IIS, 2021), which comprises annotated translations of Qur'anic commentaries and extensive introductory materials, including a chapter on women in the Qurʾān. This latter forms the basis for her current project, also with Feras Hamza, a critical introduction to women in the Qurʾān. She is also writing a book entitled *Islamic Affect: Emotions from Muḥammad to the Middle Ages*. She has published articles on subjects as diverse as women's right to be judges in Islamic law, the audiences of tafsir, and emotional rhetoric in the Qurʾān. Dr. Bauer serves on the board and the nominating committee of the International Qur’anic Studies Association (IQSA). Many of her publications can be found on her [academia.edu page](https://iis.academia.edu/KarenBauer).
