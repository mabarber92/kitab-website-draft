The work of KITAB project relies heavily on collaboration, especially multidisciplinary collaboration. We believe that this should be at the core of Digital Humanities projects. Many of our collaborators do not work in Arabic or in history, but it is our goal to ensure that such collaborative work can benefit all of those involved.

Some examples of the kinds of collaborative work that we do:
* Engaging with subject specialists to grow the corpus and make it more representative.
* Helping those analysing texts to annotate their texts with [OpenITI mARkdown]({{ '/corpus/markdown' | relative_url }}), allowing both sides to benefit from future analysis of OpenITI texts.
* Helping us to identify issues with texts in the corpus (perhaps parts of them are missing, or the metadata is incorrect) For this, see also our guidance on [submitting issues](https://openiti.github.io/documentation/#raising-github-issues).
* Working with Computer Scientists and Computational Linguists to help them develop and refine machine-learning-based approaches for classical Arabic (for more, see the [current challenges]({{ '/methods/challenges' | relative_url }}) in working with classical Arabic).

All of our collaborations are founded on the principals of data sharing. For example, if you share texts or help expand the corpus then we will share our text-reuse data in return. 

Do you think you could help KITAB's work? We are excited to hear from you.
