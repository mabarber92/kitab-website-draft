The KITAB team works to develop a curated corpus of Arabic texts to which we apply various [digital methods]({{ '/methods' | relative_url }}). These methods produce data sets that we use to better understand the corpus and Arabic book history and to answer different research questions.
In the sections that follow, you can learn about the corpus, about the manner in which it is created, curated and structured, and about our data and the applications and visualisations that we are developing to help us and other researchers understand our data.
