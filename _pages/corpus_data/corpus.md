KITAB corpus is KITAB’s constantly evolving corpus of machine-readable (mostly) premodern Arabic texts and metadata files.

As such, it is the very backbone of the research KITAB seeks to advance: It is with regard to this corpus that the scholars from the humanities and the computer scientists who make up KITAB’s team have joined forces to make possible new forms of computer-aided analysis of the premodern Arabic tradition.

KITAB corpus necessarily is a work in progress, and containing the material with which KITAB works, it requires much attention on our part. 

We constantly annotate and improve the quality of our texts, add new texts and metadata, and we put a good amount of conceptual work into making room for the specificities of the premodern Arabic textual tradition and questions of survival bias. 

Irrespective of their usage by KITAB, all files contained in the KITAB corpus are available to everyone and for free. 

KITAB corpus is not an online library or reading environment, though. It shares various elements with the latter insofar as individual works can be accessed online and downloaded.

Nonetheless, we are building our corpus to generate specific [data]({{ '/data' | relative_url }}) from it such as data regarding [text reuse]({{ '/methods/text-reuse' | relative_url}}). From the perspective of KITAB, our corpus is meaningful in its integration with those data sets, and it is from them that we build our [applications]({{ '/data/apps' | relative_url }}).

The fundamental criteria which all material in our corpus therefore must meet is to allow the successful application of our core digital tools, that is, it must be machine-readable according to our own needs.

These specifications are decisive insofar as they bear upon our priorities and, collaterally, upon the issues of text quality and availability of metadata.

KITAB is interested in vetted texts and in metadata that is as rich as possible. But our corpus evolves step by step and progresses, most notably, through subprojects with their particular needs and involving particular subsets of texts and metadata items.
 
But just as our diverse subprojects constantly make us improve our corpus according to our own needs, other users should improve it according to their needs.

Please, feel most welcome to [reach out to us]({{ '/about/get-involved' | relative_url }}) and share any ideas you might have with regard to our corpus or if you have any subproject you feel is an important and suitable contribution to our corpus. 

KITAB corpus has benefitted from many generous contributions from the field, and we hope that many more will follow.
