All of our texts are tagged according to a uniform, mARkdown-based, annotation scheme which ensures that the files can be easily identified and accessed using various scripts, allowing us to apply digital methods at the corpus level, or select a particular part of the corpus for analysis (potentially based on metadata).
 
Annotation further allows for files to be analysed or compared at the structural level (at the level of specific chapters, sections of paragraphs) The structure of the corpus might look unfamiliar to those used to accessing texts through libraries, but it is essential for performing digital tasks at scale.

For a detailed explanation of mARkdown and the annotation process, see [here]({{ '/docs/openITI#4-annotation-guidelines' | relative_url}})
